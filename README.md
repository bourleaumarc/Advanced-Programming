#  Creating a user-interface for watch selection - Advanced Programming Project
Our main objective for this university project was to build a Tkinter's dashboard to help consumers find their dream watch. As the wealth of information on the internet continues to expand, it's becoming increasingly challenging for consumers to find their dream swiss wristwatch. Therefore, we have **scraped** the website Watchbase and created a user-friendly interface where consumers can filter watches based on the watch characteristic, such as diameter, color, etc... 

The structure of the project is as follows:

1. images_scraping.py: code to scrape all the images. The output is the folder 1.1 Watches_Images that contains all the images scrapped (we will only upload one image as an example)
2. watch_text.py: code to scrape all the text characteristics of the watches. The output is the 2.1 watch_text.csv
3. mapping.py: we map all the images to the text characteristics. The output is 3.1 data_with_mages.csv 
4. Tkinter's interface: code to build the Tkinter's GUI. Images used in the Tkinter's are stored in 5.1 tkinter_images 
5. Report: explanation of the project in detail
